alt: A screen with an AI icon and an arrow pointing to a human icon, accompanying text says "Speak to a human".

advantages:
 - Helps people get the help they need in real time.
 - Reduces the frustration of being “stuck” in an AI system loop.
 - Better supports vulnerable users with specific needs.

limitations:
 - As AI systems improve, people may not believe that they are talking to another person (even when they are).

examples:
 - title: Peppercorn

   description: Their Pipr chatbot lets users transfer to a person in session.
 - title: Flock

   description: Flock, an insurance company, puts a button in the corner of each screen that lets pilots speak to someone about their insurance quote or other elements of the app.

Make it easy to get in touch with a real person, within the interface of the service. It should be made clear that the user will be connected to a real person, not an AI.

This pattern does not redirect someone to a webpage to see how to contact a person. The pattern connects the user to a person instantly, within their existing session.

For example, when speaking with an automated assistant, users should always have the option of speaking directly to a human.

IF thinks this pattern is becoming more important as more AI systems are used in complex decisions that impact people’s lives.  Providing options that enable people to make a choice is also a more inclusive option.
