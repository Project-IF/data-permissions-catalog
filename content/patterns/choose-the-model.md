images:
 - url: /images/choose-the-model.svg
alt: A dialogue allowing a user to choose between "model A", "model B" and "model C"

advantages:
 - Increases user’s agency and control.
 - Enables a more meaningful and active relationship between the user and the system itself.
 - Supports a user through a change in their life, for example a new job.

limitations:
 - The UI must be clear and unambiguous so it is not misunderstood by the user (or the AI).

examples:
 - title: Claude
   url: http://claude.ai/
   description: Anthropic gives controls for Claude Pro users to improve their experience. For example, users can select which model version of Claude they want to power their chat experience.

Let people take control of the model they want to use. This means a previous model could continue providing a service, rather than the ‘latest’ model.

For example, someone could choose a model that has been trained to perform in a specific way, that the user wants to preserve or return to, or in professional settings where reliability of output is important.

IF thinks this pattern helps to engender a trustworthy relationship between the person and the AI system, by giving people choice of model.
